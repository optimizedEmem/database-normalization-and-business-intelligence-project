MumsNet was founded in 2003 and has grown over the last years to become a UK leading specialist
brand for mothers-to-be and mothers of babies and pre-school children.

They offer a collection of maternity clothes, nursery equipment, accessories and toys for babies and
toddlers, as well as baby clothes from new-born to 3 years old.

MumsNet markets and sells its products through its own retail stores and online via its own website
MumsNet.com. The company launched its online store at the start of 2005 and has done
significantly well as online sales have grown every year since then.

The management team at MumsNet would like to make improvements to its existing IT system to
ensure that it meets the increasing volume of sales transactions and customer registrations.

review of the SQL Server database tables supporting the online sales application and implement
improvements where you see fit.

platform to their organisation. They would like to start analysing the data collected from the online
store as they are increasingly convinced that this analysis would provide an immediate benefit to
their business.

Deliverables
-----------------

1. Deliverable D1 on database design, optimisation (D1.1) and transaction processing (D1.2) as a
backup SQL database file (.bak)
2. Deliverable D2 on a ‘proof of concept’ business intelligence platform, as a SSAS project (.sln)
3. Deliverable D3 is a demo in a 5-minute long video where you briefly outline your solutions for
both Deliverables D1, D2 and show that they work.

### D1.1 – database design, optimisation:
Your team has reviewed the MumsNet.com database tables and has made the observation that the
OrderItem, Product and Customer tables are not normalised to the third normal form (3NF). 

### D1.2 – transaction processing:
Your team has also been asked to develop new stored procedures to deliver order processing
functionality for the new Order Group Entity:

a) Develop the stored procedure prCreateOrderGroup; the execution of this program will
create a new order
b) Develop the stored procedure prCreateOrderItem; the execution of this program will create
a new order line 

The new stored procedures must contain error handling and transactional support to ensure
that the data consistency is maintained during successful and unsuccessful program execution

### D2 Business Intelligence Solution
Your team has been asked to deliver a ‘proof of concept’ business intelligence platform using
Microsoft SQL Server 2018 Analysis Services (SSAS/SSDT).
You will need to create an appropriate Data Source View (DSV) and design corresponding Cube
measures and dimensions

### Skills optimized after this project
1. Writing complex SQL queries
2. Stored Procedures
3. Database Normalization
4. Business Intelligence solution using Microsoft SQL Server 2018 Analysis Services (SSAS/SSDT)
